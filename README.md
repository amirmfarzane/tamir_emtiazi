AP Spring 1401 Refactoring Assignment.

To use the judge, make sure you have the tests in the `tests/` directory,
in the same place as the judge (see the directory format below.)

```
.
├── judge.sh
├── ...
└── tests
    ├── in
    │   ├── ...
    └── out
        ├── ...
```

To run the judge, run the `judge.sh` script and pass in the name of your source file:
```
./judge.sh <source_file>
```

For example, if your source file is called `solution.cpp`,
then you can run the judge using the following command:
```
./judge.sh solution.cpp
```
